1) EC2 - Elastic Cloud computing ECC is a virutual server running on AWS infrastructure. Simply a server/hardware box
2) Load balancer - ELB Elastic Load Balancer
3) ASG - Automatic scaling group

Managed services -> Elastic Beans talk



VM > OS > App runtime (jre etc) > code ==> container image

Elastic beans talk toakes container image and manage everything

If you have single and smallr services (container images) Elastic beans talk is simple solution. A managed service.

But lot of microservices, orchestration service better go with Kubernetes called EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service

ECS is elastic container service is simlar to EKS but prior aws own orchestration service. Now AWS support both ECS/EKS

Serverless - give a piece of code to aws ask to manage for 10 req or 10K reqs. AWS lambda handles it

========
Managed compute services vs Managed database services

Relational DB / SQL -RDS (Relation database services, is Amazon managed database service


NoSQL - consistance is not so important, but sclability is high. could be little bit out of sync between regions, but instantaniously avaiable. millions of tx per sec like social media
DynamoDB is NOSQL but document based DB json objects

Analytics database - BI - reporting data - redshift - huge huge amound of data 
AWS REDSHIFT, HADOOP

AWS DATA PIPELINES - similar to ETL loading from transactional db to analytical DB
 
--------
Amazon Elastic block store - EBS is like harddisc, you can attach your EC2 instance. To store any type data
EFS is elastic file store - file system

EBS / EFS can be plugged and shared between multiple EC2 instances

Object storage - buckets with key value data. video/audio bigger size. Rest api to pull the value with key. Static website. S3 is simple storage service. Used for front end Route53 is domain naming service by amazon. Cloud frontend
=========
security

VPC - virtual private cloud
private and public subnet
configure what is allow access / not.

managed VPN virutualprivate network, is to conenct over internet a private data center on premice to talk to a private subnet/VPC database
Instead, we can have a "direct connect" rather going through internet and vpn


================
Queueing services
Amazon SQS simple queue service
